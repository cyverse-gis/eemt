# About EEMT

## Project History

The Effective Energy and Mass Transfer (EEMT) framework was developed by the Critical Zone Observatory community to provide a quantitative approach for understanding energy and mass flux in Earth's Critical Zone.

### Timeline

**2005**: Initial EEMT framework developed by Rasmussen et al.  
**2011**: Open system thermodynamics integration (Rasmussen et al.)  
**2014**: Topographic and vegetation effects quantified (Rasmussen et al.)  
**2016**: High-performance computing implementation (Swetnam et al.)  
**2025**: Modern data infrastructure and cloud computing integration

## Core Principles

### Open Science

- All code is open source and freely available
- Methods are peer-reviewed and reproducible
- Data sources are publicly accessible
- Results are validated against field measurements

### FAIR Data Principles

- **Findable**: Comprehensive metadata and documentation
- **Accessible**: Public repositories and APIs
- **Interoperable**: Standard formats and protocols
- **Reusable**: Clear licensing and attribution

### Community-Driven Development

- Collaborative development model
- Multiple institutional partnerships
- Student training and education
- International research network

## Technical Philosophy

### Energy-Based Framework

EEMT uses energy flux as a common currency to integrate:

- Solar radiation and climate processes
- Biological productivity and carbon cycling
- Hydrologic partitioning and water balance
- Geomorphologic processes and landscape evolution

### Scale Integration

From local processes to continental patterns:

- **Plot scale**: 1-100 m² detailed process studies
- **Hillslope scale**: 0.01-1 km² terrain effects
- **Catchment scale**: 1-1000 km² watershed analysis
- **Regional scale**: >1000 km² climate gradient studies

### Temporal Integration


From daily variations to millennial trends:

- **Daily**: Solar radiation and weather processes
- **Monthly**: Vegetation growth and seasonal patterns  
- **Annual**: Climate averages and interannual variability
- **Decadal**: Long-term trends and climate change
- **Centennial**: Landscape evolution and soil formation
