# sol
This is the version of Sol intended to run on OpenTopography.org.

The basic input is a DEM \*.tif file which is not reprojected - it stays in the reference projection.
The script generates 365 days of global radiation (Watt hours) and daily hours of light (hours) in one folder called 'daily'. It also calculates the net monthly global radiation and sun hours in another folder called 'monthly'.
